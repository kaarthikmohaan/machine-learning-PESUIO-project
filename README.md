# machine-learning-PESUIO-project

Successfully completed a machine learning project focused on estimating regression coefficients using a linear model, as part of an advanced peer-to-peer learning initiative at PESU IO, Bangalore. The project involved implementing linear regression algorithms, optimizing model parameters through gradient descent, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error to ensure predictive accuracy.

# Project Objective's

- Implement a linear regression model using `scikit-learn` to estimate coefficients based on randomly generated training data, ensuring efficient computation with multi-threading using the `n_jobs=-1` parameter.
- Generate synthetic datasets for training by applying a custom linear equation, where multiple random inputs are mapped to an output using predefined coefficients, enabling the model to learn these relationships.
- Train the model by fitting the input dataset (`X`) and output target (`Y`), and evaluate its performance by making predictions on test data, comparing predicted results with expected outcomes.
- Extract and analyze the estimated coefficients of the linear regression model to assess the model's accuracy in learning the underlying linear relationships between the variables.
